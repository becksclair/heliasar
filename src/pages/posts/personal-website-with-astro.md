As a software engineer, I've always been passionate about creating personal projects that showcase my skills and interests. Recently, I decided to create my new website using Astro, a static site builder that allows for the use of React components.

The purpose of my website is to act as a portfolio project host, a place where I can showcase my personal photography projects and music creations as a DJ. Astro appealed to me because of its performance, flexibility and the ability to incorporate React components into a static site.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a static site builder that is designed to bring modern web development to static sites. It allows developers to use React components, Sass, and other modern web development tools to create fast, responsive sites. Additionally, it provides features like code splitting, prefetching, and lazy loading, which helps to improve site performance.

One of the major benefits of using Astro is the ability to create dynamic, interactive components that can be reused throughout the site. This is particularly useful when building a portfolio site, as it allows for the easy creation of custom components to showcase projects.
